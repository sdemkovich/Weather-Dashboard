This application allows the user to retrieve weather data for cities using OpenWeather API.  
Search for a city, and dashboard will display current 
conditions include temperature, humidity,  
wind speed and UV index (with severity) for the current day of that city. Additionally, the 5 day forecast will display.  
When the user searches for a city, it is added to their search history and a button is created that the user may click on to revisit the conditions for that city.
